  - Event-driven authoring for linting and committing
---
Developed a linting workflow that was used company-wide to ensure that all code used in smart contracts on the blockchain and on the frontend UI, adhered to their practices. Enforced company code practices using linting libraries like eslint, solhint to ensure errors were thrown or automated fixes were implemented when commits were made and automated these checks using husky for event driven checks when committing with git. Even commit messages were made to be linted as per company rules.
