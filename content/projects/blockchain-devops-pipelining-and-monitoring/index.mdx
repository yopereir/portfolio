Worked in DevOps to create a CI/CD workflow to create builds, check linting and implement tests for the blockchain apps within source control. Used mocha, chai for testing and Docker for containerizing a ganache-cli run blockchain test network. Implemented the workflow on Github actions with automated linting, testing and error reporting of the blockchain app.
