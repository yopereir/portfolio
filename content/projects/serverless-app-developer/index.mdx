Collaborated with the City of Syracuse and Syracuse University to create an online form that ran on AWS Lambda to let city government bodies apply for a cyber-safe rating by filling out a form that measured how likely the city could fall victim to cyber-attacks. Used AWS Cognito to ensure identity credentials was stored securely, API Gateway for routing of the site, DynamoDb for serverless database storage and Lambda for serverless processing of the submitted forms.
