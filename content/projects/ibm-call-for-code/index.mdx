Developed an auction [Blockchain platform](https://github.com/yopereir/ibmcfc) using Hyperledger Fabric and IBM Cloud services to facilitate relief centers to obtain suppliers that bid the lowest for their services of delivering resources. We also implemented a machine learning model that used a regression algorithm to predict the quantity of resources that would be needed by the relief centers so they could make informed decisions when creating the auction. IBM Cloud's IOT service was used to simulate devices that sent testing data to the ML model.
