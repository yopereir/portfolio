Developed a CI/CD workflow on Gitlab to create builds, implement tests and deploy to production. Tests were run on Gitlab provided containers and errors were automatically reported. Created Workflow files to orchestrate the CI/CD process on Gitlab from pushing locally to deployment on production.
Implemented a workflow on Github actions with automated deploying, testing and error reporting of a blockchain app. Used mocha, chai for testing and Docker for containerizing a ganache-cli to run a blockchain test network. Smart contracts developed were tested on testnets and then deployed to Ethereum blockchain mainnet.
